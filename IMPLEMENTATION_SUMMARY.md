   - TOML-based configuration with validation
   - Automatic compliance checking on load
   - Sample configuration generation

3. **Document Control Module** (`src/document.rs`)
   - FDA document lifecycle management structure
   - Document status workflow (Draft → Review → Approved → Effective)
   - Document type classification (SOP, Work Instructions, etc.)
   - Validation for FDA compliance requirements

4. **Library Module** (`src/lib.rs`)
   - FDA compliance constants and version tracking
   - Audit trail field requirements validation
   - Modular architecture for easy extension

5. **Main Application** (`src/main.rs`)
   - **NEW**: Async TUI application integration with tokio runtime
   - **NEW**: Comprehensive startup sequence with FDA validation
   - **NEW**: TUI framework initialization and component verification
   - Configuration loading and compliance verification
   - Sample configuration demonstration

### TUI Framework Integration (NEW - TASK-013)
6. **TUI Application Layer** (Framework Implemented)
   - Complete ratatui-based terminal user interface
   - Async application runtime with tokio
   - FDA-compliant startup sequence
   - All core modules accessible through TUI
   - Navigation system and menu structure ready
   - Database, security, and audit systems integrated
